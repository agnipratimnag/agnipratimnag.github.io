I've been playing the guitar for about 7 years, and I'm also a beginner keyboard player. I spend a ton of time everyday listening to music. During studying, eating, showering, cycling, before going to sleep, you name it. 
My favorite artists include Ramin Djawadi, Hans Zimmer, Linkin Park and Ed Sheeran. Favorite album of all time? Westworld Season 1 OST. That soundtrack was nothing short of amazing, I could listen to it a million times, especially 'Dr. Ford'. Also, if you haven't watched the show, you're doing something wrong. Fix it.
