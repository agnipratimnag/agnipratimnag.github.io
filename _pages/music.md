I've been playing the guitar for about 7 years, and I'm also a beginner keyboard player. I spend a ton of time everyday listening to music. During studying, eating, showering, cycling, before going to sleep, you name it.<br>
My favorite artists include Ramin Djawadi, Hans Zimmer, Linkin Park and Ed Sheeran. Favorite album of all time? Westworld Season 1 OST. That soundtrack was nothing short of amazing, I could listen to it a million times, especially 'Dr. Ford'. Also, if you haven't watched the show, you're doing something wrong. Fix it.<br>
