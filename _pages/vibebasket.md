### Simplifying outings through personal experiences

An entrepreneurship project founded by [Himank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himank-gupta-069865190/), now being worked on to turn into a fully functional application by [Priyam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyam-garg-9a657821a/), [Aadish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aadish-sethiya-397a39251/), [Premankur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/premankur-chakraborty-60a793252/) and me!

## The Elevator Pitch

ViBe Basket helps people solve the tediousness of planning an entire outing themselves by providing curated itineraries, which are better than blanket suggestions online because we rely on personal experiences.

This idea is still very much a work in progress. Any feedback you have is most welcome, do send it over to me at my email. I will attach a survey form here later, as weâ€™ll eventually get down to customer discovery.
