My research interests at present broadly include Compressed Sensing and Computational Imaging. 
This is aimed at developing techniques that make imaging more data-efficient, by measuring less data and utilizing algorithms to reconstruct the original signal.
This has significant applications in medical imaging, bioengineering, and satellite photography. For instance, it allows for reduced exposure during invasive radiation imaging procedures, making them considerably safer. 
I did my undergraduate thesis in this domain under the guidance of [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/). A journal paper is currently in progress.

Prior to this, when I was a confused sophomore student, I worked on a research problem in Temporal Logics in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, guided by [Prof. Krishna S](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~krishnas/) and [Dr. Khushraj Madnani](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~kmadnani/).
We succeeded in establishing a formal proof to show the equivalence of two logic classes, potentially establishing the most expressive known logic over finite timed words. I received the Undergraduate Research Award from IIT Bombay for this work. Our paper can be found at [arXiv:2411.00117](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00117).
