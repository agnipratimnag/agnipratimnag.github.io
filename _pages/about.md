Hello! My name is Agnipratim Nag, but you can just call me Agni. I’m a sophomore student in the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay, also pursuing a Minor Degree in Computer Science.

I really like understanding stuff at a very intuitive level, so much so that I could boil any idea down to some very easy to grasp thoughts. I always try my best to implement that in everything I learn, although it is quite difficult sometimes. At the moment I do not have any particular academic interests, still in the process of exploring everything that is out there. Some things I have really enjoyed learning are Automata Theory in Computer Science, The Special Theory of Relativity and Graph Theory.

When I’m not being crushed by coursework, I like to spend time playing football, listening to music, strumming songs on my guitar or gaming with my friends!
