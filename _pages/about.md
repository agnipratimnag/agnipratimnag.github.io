Hello! I'm Agnipratim, but call me Agni. I'm a second year undergraduate student at [the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay.](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in)
I am also pursuing a Minor in Computer Science. I'm still figuring out my academic interests. The only thing I **really** like right now is Special Relativity.

When I'm not being crushed by coursework, I like to spend time playing football, listening music, strumming songs on my guitar or gaming with my friends!
