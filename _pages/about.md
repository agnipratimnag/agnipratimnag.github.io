Hello! My name is Agnipratim Nag, but you can just call me Agni. I’m a sophomore student at the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay, also pursuing a Minor Degree in Computer Science.

I really like understanding stuff at a very intuitive level, so much so that I could boil any idea down to some very easy to grasp thoughts. I always try my best to implement that in everything I learn, although it is quite difficult sometimes.<br> In Physics, I have really enjoyed learning about Special Relativity, Thermodynanics and Quantum Mechanics but my research interests mostly lie in Theoretical Computer Science in the domain of Formal Methods and Logic.

I also take some time out from my academic schedule to work on an application my friends and I are building, which is aimed at being an AI driven logistic planning tool to simplify the process of planning outings for everyone. When I’m not being crushed by coursework, I like to spend time playing football, listening to music, strumming songs on my guitar or gaming with my friends!
