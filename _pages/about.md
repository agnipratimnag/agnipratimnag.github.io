Hello! My name is Agnipratim Nag, but you can just call me Agni. I’m a final year undergraduate at the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay, also pursuing a Dual Minor in Computer Science and Engineering & Machine Intelligence and Data Science.

I really like understanding stuff at a very intuitive level, so much so that I could boil any idea down to some very easy to grasp thoughts. I always try my best to implement that in everything I learn, although it is quite difficult sometimes.<br> In Physics, I have really enjoyed learning about Special Relativity, Thermodynamics and Quantum Mechanics but my research interests mostly lie in the domain of Image Processing - Compressed Sensing, to be specific.

I also spend time on various entreprenuerial ventures that my friends and I have worked on that are aimed at using technology to simplify day to day tasks for everyday people. When I’m not being crushed by coursework, I like to spend time playing football, listening to music, strumming songs on my guitar or gaming with my friends!
