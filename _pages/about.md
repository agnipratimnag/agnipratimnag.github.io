Hi there, I'm Agnipratim, a sophomore student at the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay. I am also pursuing a Minor in Computer Science. I really like understanding stuff at a very intuitive level, so much so that I could boil any idea down to some very easy to grasp thoughts. I always try my best to implement that in everything I learn, although it is quite difficult sometimes. At the moment I do not have any particular academic interests, still "exploring" everything that is out there. 

When I'm not being crushed by coursework, I like to spend time playing football, listening to music, strumming songs on my guitar or gaming with my friends!
