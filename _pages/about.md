Hello! I'm Agnipratim, but call me Agni. I'm a second year undergraduate student at the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay. I am also pursuing a Minor in Computer Science. I'm still figuring out my academic interests, a bit confused in that sphere to be honest. The only thing I **really** like right now is Special Relativity.

When I'm not being crushed by coursework, I like to spend time playing football, listening to music, strumming songs on my guitar or gaming with my friends!
