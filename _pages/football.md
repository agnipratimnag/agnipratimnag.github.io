Funnily enough, I was a hardcore cricket fan till 5th grade, had a poster of Virat Kohli on my bedroom door and all that. It was around that time that I started getting into football, playing regularly during PT period at school, enjoying it so much that I asked my dad to sign me up for "football class". That was where I would spend my evenings during the year, and sometimes even go for the two month long summer camp. As my interest in football grew, I was faced with more difficult choices, "_Which club do I support?_","_Messi or Ronaldo?_","_Which nation?_". I chose FC Barcelona, Lionel Messi and Argentina. Yes. I am a very big Messi fanboy, and it's best I admit it early on.<br>

Now that I was playing regularly, I was also getting quite good at football. I decided to go for the school football team selections, and give it a shot. Fortunately, I got selected. This was an amazing experience for me - waking up at 6am to play football with my friends, showing up late to morning assembly because me and the boys were changing up after practice, going for tournaments around Bangalore and putting on a show in front of other schools. I felt so "cool" being part of the school football team, it was great.<br>
